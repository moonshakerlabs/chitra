# CHITRA – Complete Health Input & Tracking

CHITRA is a calm, privacy-first health tracking app designed initially for women.  
It focuses on **manual logging**, **self-awareness**, and **long-term patterns** — without accounts, cloud storage, ads, or subscriptions.

All data stays **locally on the user’s device** and belongs entirely to the user.

---

## ✨ Key Principles

- **Privacy-first**: No accounts, no cloud, no background uploads
- **Offline-first**: Works fully without internet
- **User-controlled data**: Manual export, import, and deletion
- **Calm & non-clinical**: No diagnosis, no coaching, no fear-based alerts
- **Simple by design**: Built for consistency, not overwhelm

---

CHITRA is created with care for real-life usage — imperfect logs, busy days, and changing routines are all part of the journey.

Simple. Private. Yours.
